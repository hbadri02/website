    <p>Hello, you're probably wondering why the website is called WaterDelRey, well, buckle-up because this is going to
      be a long ride. <br> I am Hajer Albadri, a computer science major at
      UNCG, and I have a hard time choosing between spending my free time on gaming with friends or work on personal
      projects like this website youre on right now<br></p>

      alt="Kyle Supple" />
    <p>Kyle and I met on discord in 2020 when choosing a group to work with in our CSC 340 class which is software
      engineering. We worked on a cryptocurrency tracker JavaFX application
      (check the projects tab for more information), he carried so hard. Long story short, he's extremely intelligent,
      at least when it comes to coding, thoughtful, sweet, and kind.
      Working by his side always motivates me to do better and get better, he even pushes me to do things that I think
      am not capable of. I have learnt a lot from him and from working
      with him on projects.</p>

    <p>Thank you, Kyle, for pushing me to do and achieve things that are not necessarily school related. You taught me
      that I am capable of learning new programming languages, coding
      using features I'm not familiar with, and climbing trees :)</p>
